Project MMO - Iron's Spells and Spellbooks Compatability mod.
-------------------------------------------

This mod adds the ability to put USE requirements onto a spell/spell spell level, requiring the user to have the required skill level to cast the spell.

It also adds experience when a player casts a spell that heals or fortifies another player.
