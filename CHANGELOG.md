### 1.0.1
Screen text now reads from lang files, and processes lang strings properly.
Mod now requires Project MMO and Irons Spells and Spellbooks instead of bundling it with the mod.
---
### 1.0.2
Requirements now respect Project MMO's ignore requirements attribute. Admins or datapacks that specify
players who ignore requirements will not be restricted in casting or inscribing spells.
